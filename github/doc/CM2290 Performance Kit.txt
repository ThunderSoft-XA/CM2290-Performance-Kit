Hello everyone, now I show you is based on CM2290 performance test development kit.  The app tests the performance of the CM2290 by displaying a multi-channel camera, which is displayed on the app.  Here is my demo scenario.  First of all, the IP Camera is connected to the CM2290 in the same LAN. The CM2290 is connected to the display through HDMI. The CM2290 obtains the video stream from the IP Camera through RTSP protocol, displays the multi-channel Camera data, and observes whether there is frame drop and lag.  To launch the demo, open the application and click Settings to add an RTSP video stream.  Now we can see the multicamera data displayed on the application.  All right, that's the end of the demo.
